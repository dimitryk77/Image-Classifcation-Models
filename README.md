### Image Classification Using ANN, CNN, and ResNet50 Neural Network Architectures
The paper explores the selection of a proper deep neural network architecture, ANN, CNN, or the ResNet50 transfer learning model for image classification. The analysis consists of 7 experiments (12 models in all), utilizing the CIFAR-10 dataset and the Keras library in Python. The experiments start with the analysis of ANNs and CNNs with two and then three hidden layers (convolution/max-pooling layers for CNNs). Next, regularization is introduced for all of the models in the form of dropout and batch normalization. Additional experiments are conducted utilizing hyperparameter tuning to improve performance and data augmentation to further decrease overfitting. The final experiment explores transfer learning using the ResNet50 CNN architecture, which achieved the best CIFAR-10 test set accuracy score of all the models at 86.18%.

**Software:** Python, Keras/TensorFlow
